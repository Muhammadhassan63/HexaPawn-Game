TOPIC: MODIFIED HEXAPAWN
------------------------

EXPLANATION
-----------
Hexapawn is a simple two-player board game that was invented by Martin Gardner in 1962. It is played on a 3x3 grid, although variations can be played on larger grids as well. The game is played with pawns, similar to chess, but with simplified rules.

RULES
------
The game is played on a 5 x 5 grid.
There are two players: the player ('X') and the bot ('O').
Each player starts with five pawns placed on one side of the board.
The objective for the players is to move two of their pawns to the opposite side of the board.
On a player's turn, they can move one of their pawns forward to an empty adjacent space in the same column or capture an opponent's pawn diagonally.
GAME ENDINGS
If the player moves two of their pawns to the opposite side, they win.
If neither player can make a legal move, the game ends in a draw.
